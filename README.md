# software-design
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) wanted the game 'Draw It or Lose It' to be served running on a web-server on different platforms.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I made reccomendations to the client while highlighting the pros and cons of each option
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helped to keep me on track while developing the code
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the operating systems architechture section because I felt that it was the area that I lacked the most knowledge in.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I looked at what the client wanted and sought out the various ways that they could be implemented. The client is the decision maker in these situations, so it is important to adhere to there requirements.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it with an open mind. There are many ways to fulfil a requirement, so it is important to highlight the differences to the client. I beleive that I would approach it in a similar fashion.
